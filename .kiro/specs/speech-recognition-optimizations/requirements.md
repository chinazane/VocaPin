# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines optimizations for the VocaPin app's speech recognition feature to enhance user experience and functionality. The improvements focus on real-time audio visualization, progress indication, audio recording capabilities, and debugging support through enhanced logging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time audio waveforms that accurately reflect my voice input, so that I can visually confirm that my speech is being captured properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is speaking THEN the audio wave visualization SHALL display waveforms that correspond to the actual audio input levels
2. WHEN the user speaks louder THEN the wave amplitude SHALL increase proportionally
3. WHEN the user speaks softer THEN the wave amplitude SHALL decrease proportionally
4. WHEN the user is silent THEN the wave visualization SHALL show minimal baseline activity
5. WHEN audio input changes frequency THEN the wave pattern SHALL reflect the frequency variations in real-time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual progress indicator during recording, so that I know how much time remains and can manage my speech accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording starts THEN the circular progress indicator SHALL begin showing elapsed time
2. WHEN time passes during recording THEN the progress circle SHALL fill proportionally to time elapsed
3. WHEN the recording reaches the timeout limit THEN the progress circle SHALL be completely filled
4. WHEN the recording times out THEN the system SHALL automatically stop recording
5. WHEN the user stops recording manually THEN the progress indicator SHALL reset for the next session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my speech to be recorded and saved as an audio file, so that I can have a backup of my voice input for reference or playback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts speaking THEN the system SHALL begin recording audio to a WAV file
2. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL finalize and save the WAV file
3. WHEN recording is complete THEN the WAV file SHALL be stored in the app's documents directory
4. WHEN multiple recordings are made THEN each recording SHALL have a unique filename with timestamp
5. WHEN the app lacks storage permissions THEN the system SHALL request appropriate permissions before recording

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to log the file path of recorded audio files, so that I can debug audio recording functionality and verify file creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a WAV file is created THEN the system SHALL print the complete file path to the console log
2. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL log the intended file path for the recording
3. WHEN recording fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempted file path
4. WHEN the file is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL log confirmation with the final file path
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the log entries SHALL include timestamps and clear identification of the recording session
