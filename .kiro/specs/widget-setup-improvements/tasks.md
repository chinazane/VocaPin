# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
Convert the widget setup experience improvements into discrete coding tasks that ensure proper modal presentation and optimal sizing for the WidgetSetupView.

- [x] 1. Verify and fix widget toggle modal presentation
  - Ensure ProfileSettingsView.SettingsSection properly presents WidgetSetupView as sheet
  - Verify handleWidgetToggle function correctly sets showWidgetSetup state to true when enabled
  - Test that modal appears when widget toggle is turned ON
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement proper modal presentation configuration
  - Add presentationDetents([.height(500), .large]) to sheet modifier
  - Add presentationDragIndicator(.visible) for better user experience
  - Add presentationCornerRadius(20) for consistent styling
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5_

- [x] 3. Optimize WidgetSetupView layout for modal presentation
  - Reduce excessive spacing and padding that was designed for full-screen
  - Adjust font sizes to be appropriate for modal context (not too large)
  - Ensure content fits well within 500pt height without cramping
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Add proper navigation controls to modal
  - Add NavigationView wrapper with inline title display mode
  - Add "Done" button in navigation bar trailing position
  - Ensure "Got it!" button remains functional as alternative dismissal method
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Implement robust toggle state management
  - Prevent multiple modal presentations from rapid toggle interactions
  - Ensure toggle remains ON after modal dismissal
  - Handle edge case where user toggles OFF while modal is open
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Add proper background and styling for modal
  - Maintain cream/yellow sticky note background color
  - Ensure proper contrast and readability in modal context
  - Add appropriate background dimming for underlying content
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4, 2.5_

- [x] 7. Test modal behavior across different scenarios
  - Test device rotation while modal is open
  - Test app backgrounding/foregrounding with modal open
  - Verify proper dismissal with swipe gestures and tap outside
  - _Requirements: 6.3, 6.4, 2.2_

- [x] 8. Implement accessibility improvements
  - Add proper accessibility labels for modal controls
  - Ensure VoiceOver navigation works correctly through modal content
  - Test with accessibility features enabled
  - _Requirements: 6.5, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Create unit tests for toggle and modal interaction
  - Test handleWidgetToggle function behavior
  - Test modal presentation state management
  - Test edge cases with rapid toggle interactions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 6.1_

- [x] 10. Perform integration testing and polish
  - Test complete user flow from settings to widget setup
  - Verify consistent behavior across different device sizes
  - Ensure smooth animations and transitions
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 2.4, 4.4_
