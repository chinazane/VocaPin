# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Refactor AI service to support public access
  - Make generateAISummary method public in AzureChatGPT4OService
  - Add text validation method shouldAutoSummarize to check minimum word count
  - Enhance error handling to support both manual and automatic contexts
  - Create shared AI processing logic that can be called from different contexts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Add automatic AI processing state management
  - Add new state variables for automatic AI processing in NotebookEditingView
  - Implement conflict prevention between manual and automatic AI processing
  - Add enhanced status text and color logic for automatic processing indicators
  - Update AI summary button disabled state to include automatic processing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Implement automatic AI trigger after speech recognition
  - Modify speech recognition completion handler to trigger automatic AI summarization
  - Add text length validation before triggering automatic AI processing
  - Implement the automatic AI processing workflow with proper error handling
  - Ensure original transcript is added first, then replaced with AI summary
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 4. Add enhanced UI indicators for automatic processing
  - Update status indicator text to show "Auto-summarizing with AI..." during automatic processing
  - Modify AI summary button to show disabled state during automatic processing
  - Add visual feedback for automatic AI processing state
  - Ensure loading indicators work for both manual and automatic AI processing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Implement error handling and recovery for automatic AI
  - Add error dialog for automatic AI processing failures with Retry/Keep Original options
  - Implement retry functionality that re-attempts automatic AI summarization
  - Add "Keep Original Text" functionality that preserves the transcribed text
  - Handle different error types (network, processing, timeout) appropriately
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Add widget synchronization and final integration
  - Ensure widget sync occurs after automatic AI processing completes
  - Add proper cleanup of automatic processing states
  - Implement proper focus management after automatic AI completion
  - Test complete workflow from speech recognition to AI-summarized content display
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 1.3_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive testing for automatic AI workflow
  - Write unit tests for enhanced AI service public methods
  - Create integration tests for automatic AI trigger after speech recognition
  - Add tests for error handling and recovery scenarios
  - Test conflict prevention between manual and automatic AI processing
  - Verify widget synchronization after automatic AI processing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
